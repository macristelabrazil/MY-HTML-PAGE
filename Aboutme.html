    <p>That's perfectly understandable! Not everyone has to be a cat lover to appreciate the qualities and charm of cats.
    <br>Many people who may not consider themselves "cat lovers" still find cats intriguing, entertaining, or enjoy their company in certain contexts.
    <br>Cats have a unique and diverse set of characteristics that can be fascinating to observe, even for those who may not have a strong affinity for them. It's great that you can find something you like about cats, even if you don't consider yourself a dedicated cat lover.</p>
    <h2>QUOTES</h2>

    <p>I believe cats to be spirits come to earth.
    <br>A cat, I am sure, could walk on a cloud without coming through</p>
